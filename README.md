# mesh-spline-deformer
A unity asset that deforms a mesh along a bezier spline.


i've used the bezier curve package from this [rebo](https://github.com/yasirkula/UnityBezierSolution "Logo Title Text 1") and customized the code a bit

To use this tool all what you have to do is to create a embty game object and attach MeshSplineDeformer to it and add the base mesh that you want to make a deformed instance of it in baseMesh inspector property then add the material of the model in the mesh renderer
