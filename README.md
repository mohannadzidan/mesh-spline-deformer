# mesh-spline-deformer
A unity asset that deforms a mesh along a bezier spline.


i've used the bezier curve package from this [rebo](https://github.com/yasirkula/UnityBezierSolution "Logo Title Text 1") and customized the code a bit

To use this tool all what you have to do is to create an empty game object and attach MeshSplineDeformer component to it and drag the base mesh from the model you want to deform and drop it in the baseMesh inspector property and the script will automatically clone this mesh and the clone will be ready to be deformed.
